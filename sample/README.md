# Sample Project
It is simple java project with maven build manager

## Description
However, it doesn't use any dependency injector like Spring, therefore it is:
- Tightly coupled 
- Not testable
- Not reusable as with hard configuration in the code
- Has extra boilerplate codes, other than actual business logic
